# ar-url-server

## A server that recieves phone text requests and sends back a message with a url

This server is used so that users can send a text message on thier phone and recieve 
a message containing a link to a web page that the user can then view augmented reality
content in.

* it saves people from having to type a url into their phone browser
* the phone number users text is displayed on the "image marker"
* the message is also like a note in that users can close the browser and then click the link again later.
